# Chatbot-with-LLMs
**üß† Chatbot with LLMs (Large Language Models)**
This project involves the development of an intelligent chatbot application powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), integrated with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner, making it suitable for applications such as virtual assistants, customer support, and educational tools.a QA chatbot using the Gemini Pro LLM model integrated with Streamlit for an interactive UI. Implemented real-time responses using the Google Generative AI API and managed chat history with session state. Utilized dotenv for secure API key handling.

‚ú® Key Features
Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes LLMs to interpret and generate human-like responses.

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit to provide a responsive, browser-based interface for seamless user interaction.

Real-Time Conversations: Enables dynamic conversations with users, with quick response generation.

Custom Prompt Integration: Allows fine-tuning or contextual prompting for domain-specific responses.

**üîß Tech Stack**
Language Model: LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-based models or similar)

Frontend & Deployment: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Other Tools: NLP libraries for preprocessing (optional), API integration (if using external LLMs)

**üìå Use Cases**
Customer support automation

Virtual assistants for websites or applications

Educational and training bots

**üîÅ Integrating Gemini API from Google AI Studio with Streamlit**


**‚úÖ Step 1: Get Access to Gemini API**


1.Go to Google AI Studio.

2.Sign in with your Google account.

3.Create or test a prompt using Gemini.

4.Click ‚ÄúGet API Key‚Äù from the API Key tab (or go to Google MakerSuite if redirected).

5.Copy your API Key securely.

**To deploy and run your chatbot application using Streamlit, follow these steps and use the below commands:**

**‚úÖ 1. Install Streamlit (if not already installed)**

`pip install streamlit
`

**‚úÖ 2. Save your main Python script**


Make sure your main Python script (e.g., chatbot.py or app.py) contains Streamlit code like:

`import streamlit as st`

`st.title("Chatbot with LLMs")`

**‚úÖ 3. Run the Streamlit App Locally**

`streamlit run app.py`

Replace app.py with your actual script filename.

**‚úÖ 4. Optional: Stop the Server**
